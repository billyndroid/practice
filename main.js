//numbers and strings in an array

//Multi Dimensional Arrays
//Stacks: LIFO - push/pop
//Queues FIFO - push/pop
//Linked Lists: Address for next item stored allows to dynamically add/remove from list
//example of linked list from 

//LOOPS
//Use For loops when the number of times to execute loop is known. 
//Use while loop when this is unknown
//use do/while when want to execute code at least once
//use BREAK command to get out of a loop
